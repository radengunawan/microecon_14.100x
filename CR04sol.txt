### Context of the Problem

The problem involves a government initiative to ensure that all workers have access to healthcare. To fund this healthcare, the government proposes a $10 tax per worker on firms. The question asks for the equilibrium price and quantity in the labor market before the tax is implemented, assuming the value workers place on healthcare, \( H \), is zero.

### Specific Terms, Math Notations, and Formulation

1. **Demand Curve for Labor, \( D(p) \)**: 
   - **Equation**: \( D(p) = 100 - p \)
   - **Explanation**: The demand curve shows the relationship between the price of labor (\( p \)) and the quantity of labor demanded by firms. 
   - **Analogy**: Imagine you're running a business, and youâ€™re deciding how many workers to hire based on the wages you need to pay. As wages (price of labor) increase, you can afford to hire fewer workers, so the demand for labor decreases.
   - **Quantitative Example**: If the wage (\( p \)) is $20, the demand for labor would be \( D(20) = 100 - 20 = 80 \) workers.

2. **Supply Curve for Labor, \( S(p) \)**: 
   - **Equation**: \( S(p) = p + H - 10 \)
   - **Explanation**: The supply curve shows the relationship between the price of labor (\( p \)) and the quantity of labor that workers are willing to supply. \( H \) represents how much workers value healthcare services, and when healthcare is provided through the tax, it influences the supply of labor.
   - **Analogy**: Think of workers deciding whether to work based on the wages offered. If wages are higher, more workers will want to work. If the government also provides valuable healthcare, this would increase their willingness to work even at the same wage.
   - **Quantitative Example**: Without healthcare (\( H = 0 \)), if the wage (\( p \)) is $20, the supply of labor would be \( S(20) = 20 + 0 - 10 = 10 \) workers.

3. **Equilibrium Price and Quantity**:
   - **Equilibrium Price \( p^* \)**: The price of labor where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied.
   - **Equilibrium Quantity \( Q^* \)**: The corresponding quantity of labor at the equilibrium price.
   - **Equation**: Set \( D(p) = S(p) \) to find \( p^* \) and \( Q^* \).
   - **Analogy**: Imagine a marketplace where buyers and sellers agree on a price where neither side has an excess or shortage. That price is the equilibrium price.
   - **Quantitative Example**: Solving \( 100 - p = p - 10 \) gives \( p^* = 55 \) and \( Q^* = 45 \) workers.

4. **Healthcare Value \( H \)**:
   - **Explanation**: \( H \) reflects how much workers value the healthcare they receive as part of the tax-funded program. In this problem, \( H \) is initially set to 0 to simplify the analysis.
   - **Analogy**: Think of \( H \) as a bonus that makes a job more attractive. If a job offers good healthcare, a worker might be willing to accept lower wages, effectively increasing the supply of labor.

### Relationship Between Terms

- **Demand and Supply Intersection**: The equilibrium price and quantity are found where the demand and supply curves intersect. This intersection represents the balance point in the labor market where the number of workers firms want to hire equals the number of workers willing to work at that wage.
  
- **Effect of \( H \) on Supply**: If \( H \) were positive (meaning workers value the healthcare), the supply curve would shift upward by \( H \), potentially raising the equilibrium wage and altering the quantity of labor supplied. This shift would reflect workers' increased willingness to work due to the additional benefit of healthcare.

### Quantitative Example Summary

Given the equations:

- **Demand**: \( D(p) = 100 - p \)
- **Supply (with \( H = 0 \))**: \( S(p) = p - 10 \)

Setting \( D(p) = S(p) \) yields:

\[
100 - p = p - 10
\]
\[
110 = 2p
\]
\[
p^* = 55
\]
\[
Q^* = 45
\]

This gives an equilibrium price of $55 and an equilibrium quantity of 45 workers in the labor market before the tax is implemented and without the provision of healthcare.
